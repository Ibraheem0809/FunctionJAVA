# Functions / Methods in Java  

## 📌 Introduction  
A **method** in Java is a block of reusable code.  
It helps in avoiding repetition, improves readability, and makes code easier to maintain.  

👉 Example: Instead of writing `a + b` everywhere, you can make a `sum()` method.

## 📝 Syntax & Declaration  

General structure of a method:  
```java
returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // method body
    return value;  // if returnType is not void
}
🎯 Purpose & Usage

✅ Reduces code duplication

✅ Improves modularity → divide program into smaller parts

✅ Makes debugging easier

✅ Reusable across different programs

⚙️ Method Components

Return Type → void, int, boolean, String, etc.

Parameters → values passed into the method (Java is pass-by-value).

Calling a Method → inside main():

Static Methods → Can be called without creating an object.

🚀 Practice Examples

TypeFunction → prints "Hello Sidd!"

Sum of two numbers

Prime number check

Armstrong number check

Loop printing using methods
